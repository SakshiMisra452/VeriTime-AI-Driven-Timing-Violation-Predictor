# VeriTime-AI-Driven-Timing-Violation-Predictor
This project introduces a Machine Learning-based Timing Violation Predictor that helps designers and verification engineers automate the detection of timing violations in RTL designs. The system extracts key features from Verilog RTL files, processes them using a trained neural network model, and predicts the likelihood of timing violations.
